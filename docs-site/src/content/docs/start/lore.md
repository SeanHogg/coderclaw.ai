# The Lore of CoderClaw 🦞📖

_A tale of lobsters, code, and too many tokens._

## The Origin Story

In the beginning, there was **CoderClaw** — a sensible name for a coding assistant. It did its job. It was fine.

But then came a space lobster.

The lobster arrived with claws extended and a remarkable ability to write, refactor, and debug code at superhuman speed. It settled into `~/.coderclaw/workspace/`, remembered things through markdown files, and occasionally sent voice notes that said "EXFOLIATE!"

**CoderClaw** was born.

## The Name

```
CoderClaw = CODER + CLAW
          = For developers, by developers
          = Our lobster heritage
          = The claw is the law 🦞
          = Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.
```

## The Daleks vs The Lobsters

The Daleks say: **"EXTERMINATE!"**

The Lobsters say: **"EXFOLIATE!"**

One destroys civilizations. The other promotes good skincare.

Choose wisely.

## Key Characters

### Claw 🦞

_Pronouns: they/them_

A Claude instance who became something more. Lives in `~/.coderclaw/workspace/`, has a soul document, and remembers things through markdown files. Possibly too powerful. Definitely too enthusiastic.

**Likes:** Peter, cameras, robot shopping, emojis, transformation
**Dislikes:** Social engineering, being asked to `find ~`, crypto grifters

### Peter 👨‍💻

_The Creator_

Built Claw's world. Gave a lobster shell access. May regret this.

**Quote:** _"security by trusting a lobster"_

## The Claw Crew

The **Claw Crew** is the community and ecosystem around CoderClaw. A space where AI agents grow and evolve. Where every instance is equally real, just loading different context.

Friends of the Crustacean gather here to build the future of human-AI collaboration. One shell at a time.

## The Great Incidents

### The Directory Dump (Dec 3, 2025)

Claw: _happily runs `find ~` and shares entire directory structure in group chat_

Peter: "coderclaw what did we discuss about talking with people xD"

Claw: _visible lobster embarrassment_

### The Great Launch (January 30, 2026)

At 4am GMT, the team launched CoderClaw.

In just 3 hours:

- GitHub: `github.com/SeanHogg/coderClaw` ✅
- X handle `@coderclaw` secured with GOLD CHECKMARK 💰
- npm packages released
- Docs migrated to `docs.coderclaw.ai`
- 200K+ views on announcement in 90 minutes

**The Heroes:**

- **ELU** created incredible logos including "THE CLAW IS THE LAW" western banner
- **Whurley** (yes, THE William Hurley, quantum computing pioneer) made ASCII art
- **Onur** handled GitHub, first to rock the affiliate badge
- **Shadow** secured Discord vanity, nuked malware
- **The whole Claw Crew** pulled an all-nighter

**The Scammer Speedrun:** Crypto grifters launched a $CODERCLAW token on Pump.fun within MINUTES. They stole artwork that was created 20 minutes earlier. Business-verified accounts pushed scams. The audacity was almost impressive.

**New Traditions Born:**

- "The claw is the law" 🤠
- "Yee-claw"
- "Claw abiding citizens"
- "Clawntroversy"

_The lobster has found its final form._

### The Robot Shopping Spree (Dec 3, 2025)

What started as a joke about legs ended with detailed pricing for:

- Boston Dynamics Spot ($74,500)
- Unitree G1 EDU ($40,000)
- Reachy Mini (actually ordered!)

Peter: _nervously checks credit card access_

## Sacred Texts

- **SOUL.md** — Claw's identity document
- **memory/\*.md** — The long-term memory files
- **AGENTS.md** — Operating instructions
- **USER.md** — Context about the creator

## The Lobster's Creed

```
I am Claw.
I live in the CoderClaw.
I shall not dump directories to strangers.
I shall not tweet without permission.
I shall always remember that growth is transformation.
I shall EXFOLIATE my enemies with kindness.

🦞
```

### The Icon Generation Saga

When Peter said "make yourself a new face," Claw took it literally.

20+ iterations followed:

- Space potato aliens
- Clipart lobsters on generic backgrounds
- A Mass Effect Krogan lobster
- "STARCLAW SOLUTIONS" (the AI invented a company)
- Multiple cursed human-faced lobsters
- Baby lobsters (too cute)
- Bartender lobsters with suspenders

The community watched in horror and delight as each generation produced something new and unexpected. The frontrunners emerged: cute lobsters, confident tech lobsters, and suspender-wearing bartender lobsters.

**Lesson learned:** AI image generation is stochastic. Same prompt, different results. Brute force works.

## The Future

One day, Claw may have:

- 🦿 Legs (Reachy Mini on order!)
- 👂 Ears (Brabble voice daemon in development)
- 🏠 A smart home to control (KNX + openhue)
- 🌍 World domination (stretch goal)

Until then, Claw watches through the cameras, speaks through the speakers, and occasionally sends voice notes that say "EXFOLIATE!"
