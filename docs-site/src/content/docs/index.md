## What is CoderClaw?

CoderClaw is a **distributed AI runtime** built on top of [CoderClaw](https://github.com/SeanHogg/coderClaw)'s self-hosted gateway. It connects your favorite chat apps — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more — to AI coding agents, with added **Phase 2 capabilities** for secure orchestration, distributed task execution, and team collaboration.

**Who is it for?** Developers and teams who want a personal AI assistant with enterprise-ready features like RBAC, audit trails, and CI/CD integration — without giving up control of their data or relying on a hosted service.

**What makes it different from CoderClaw?**

- **Distributed Runtime**: Execute tasks locally or remotely with transport abstraction
- **Enhanced Security**: RBAC, device trust levels, and granular policy enforcement
- **Task Lifecycle Management**: Formal state machine with audit trails and resumability
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-session isolation and shared agent registries
- **CI/CD Ready**: Designed for automated workflows and team-wide deployments

**What do you need?** Node 22+, an API key (Anthropic recommended), and 5 minutes.

## How it works

The Gateway is the single source of truth for sessions, routing, and channel connections, enhanced with distributed task execution and security controls.

## Dashboard

Open the browser Control UI after the Gateway starts.

- Local default: [http://127.0.0.1:18789/](http://127.0.0.1:18789/)
- Remote access: [Web surfaces](/web) and [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale)

</p>

## Configuration (optional)

Config lives at `~/.coderclaw/coderclaw.json`.

- If you **do nothing**, CoderClaw uses the bundled Pi binary in RPC mode with per-sender sessions.
- If you want to lock it down, start with `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` and (for groups) mention rules.
- For Phase 2 features, see [Phase 2 Configuration](/phase2#configuration).

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
      groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
    },
  },
  messages: { groupChat: { mentionPatterns: ["@coderclaw"] } },
}
```
