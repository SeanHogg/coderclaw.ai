# CoderClawLink

[CoderClawLink](https://app.coderclaw.ai) is the human-facing project management portal for the CoderClaw ecosystem. It provides a Jira-style web UI for managing projects, tasks, and AI agent mesh — with Kanban, List, and Gantt views, AI-powered PRD writing via OpenRouter, drag-and-drop task management, and full multi-tenant workspace support.

## Features

### Task Board Views

CoderClawLink supports three task board views you can switch between at any time:

- **Kanban** — swim-lane board with drag-and-drop between columns (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done, Blocked)
- **List** — sortable table view with all task fields visible at a glance
- **Gantt** — timeline chart showing task start/due dates as horizontal bars, with today marker and overdue highlighting

### AI-Powered Task & PRD Writing

Use OpenRouter to generate detailed task descriptions and PRDs directly in the task creation and edit forms:

1. Go to **Workspace → AI Settings**
2. Enter your [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
3. Select a model (Claude Sonnet 4.6 recommended)
4. When creating or editing a task, click **✨ Generate with AI** to auto-write a full PRD including:
   - Objective and background
   - Acceptance criteria checklist
   - Technical implementation notes
   - Edge cases to consider

### Task Management

Each task supports:
- **Status**: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done, Blocked
- **Priority**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Agent assignment**: Claude, OpenAI, Ollama, HTTP
- **Start date & Due date** (used in Gantt view)
- **GitHub PR link** (auto-set when agent creates a PR)
- **Description / PRD** (AI-generated or manual)

### Project Management

- Create projects with a unique key (e.g., `PROJ`)
- Link to a GitHub repository for PR automation
- Auto-incremented task keys (e.g., `PROJ-001`)

### Multi-Tenant Workspaces

- Create isolated workspaces for different teams or repositories
- Invite members with roles: Viewer, Developer, Manager, Owner
- Switch between workspaces instantly

### CoderClaw Mesh

- Register any number of CoderClaw instances (claws) to your workspace
- Each claw gets a unique one-time API key
- Assign marketplace skills to your entire workspace or individual claws
- Each registered claw maintains a **live WebSocket relay** via `ClawRelayDO`:
  - When the claw's gateway is running, it connects to the relay automatically
  - Browser users can chat directly with the remote agent from the Claw panel
  - Relay status (online/offline, last seen timestamp) is shown in real time

## Architecture

CoderClawLink is built on:
- **Cloudflare Workers** — serverless edge hosting
- **Hono** — lightweight TypeScript web framework
- **Drizzle ORM + Neon Postgres** — type-safe database with serverless PostgreSQL
- **Clean Architecture** — Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation layers
- **JWT authentication** — web tokens (no-tenant) and tenant-scoped tokens

## Quick Start

### 1. Sign up

Go to [app.coderclaw.ai](https://app.coderclaw.ai) and create a free account.

### 2. Create a workspace

After logging in, create your first workspace. This is your tenant — a fully isolated environment for your team.

### 3. Create a project

Navigate to **Projects → + New Project**. Set a short key (e.g., `APP`) and a name.

### 4. Add tasks

Go to **Tasks → + New Task**. Enter a title, then click **✨ Generate with AI** to auto-write the description using OpenRouter, or write it manually.

Set start and due dates to use the Gantt view.

### 5. Register your CoderClaw

Go to **Claws → + Register Claw**. Copy the one-time API key. CoderClaw reads two environment variables from `~/.coderclaw/.env`:

```bash
CODERCLAW_LINK_API_KEY=your-key-here   # one-time key from the Claws panel
CODERCLAW_LINK_URL=https://api.coderclaw.ai  # default, can be omitted
```

You also need the claw's instance ID in your project's `.coderClaw/context.yaml` (set automatically by `coderclaw link` or the onboarding wizard):

```yaml
clawLink:
  instanceId: "42"          # numeric ID from the Claws panel
  instanceSlug: my-project
```

Once both are present, starting the CoderClaw gateway connects the relay automatically.

### 6. Configure AI settings

Go to **Workspace → AI Settings** and enter your OpenRouter API key. Choose your preferred model.

## OpenRouter Integration

CoderClawLink uses [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) as a unified gateway to access Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Llama, and other models for task and PRD generation.

**Supported models:**
| Model | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | Recommended — best quality |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` | Highest capability |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` | Fastest |
| `openai/gpt-4o` | Strong alternative |
| `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | Fast and cheap |
| `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` | Good quality/speed ratio |
| `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` | Open-weight model |

Your API key is stored locally in your browser and never sent to CoderClawLink servers. All AI calls go directly from your browser to OpenRouter.

## Task Status Flow

```
todo → in_progress → in_review → done
            ↓
         blocked
```

Drag cards between columns in Kanban view, or use the Status dropdown in the task edit modal.

## Gantt View

The Gantt view shows all tasks as horizontal timeline bars. Tasks without explicit start/due dates use `createdAt` as start and `createdAt + 7 days` as end for display purposes.

- **Bars are colored by status** (blue = in progress, cyan = in review, green = done, red = blocked)
- **Overdue tasks** are highlighted with a red outline
- **Today marker** shows the current date as a red vertical line
- Click any bar or row to open the task edit modal

## Connecting CoderClaw to CoderClawLink

CoderClaw connects to CoderClawLink in two ways simultaneously when the gateway starts.

### 1. WebSocket Relay (real-time chat)

`ClawLinkRelayService` opens a persistent WebSocket to the `ClawRelayDO` Durable Object for the registered claw:

```
GET wss://api.coderclaw.ai/api/claws/:id/upstream?key=<apiKey>
```

This enables:
- **Browser → agent**: messages typed in the browser Claw panel are forwarded to the local gateway in real time
- **Agent → browser**: streaming responses (deltas, tool calls, results) are broadcast to all connected browser sessions
- **Heartbeat**: a `PATCH /api/claws/:id/heartbeat` keeps the "Last seen" timestamp fresh every 5 minutes

### 2. HTTP Task API

CoderClaw agents can submit tasks directly via the execution API:

```
POST /api/runtime/executions           Submit a task for agent execution
GET  /api/runtime/executions/:id       Get execution state
PATCH /api/runtime/executions/:id/state  Agent callback to update state
```

```typescript
import { ClawLinkTransportAdapter } from "coderclaw/transport";

const adapter = new ClawLinkTransportAdapter({
  baseUrl: "https://api.coderclaw.ai",
  apiKey: process.env.CODERCLAW_LINK_API_KEY,
});

await adapter.connect();
const state = await adapter.submitTask({
  agentId: "claude",
  description: "Implement login page",
  input: "Create a login component with email + password fields",
});
```
