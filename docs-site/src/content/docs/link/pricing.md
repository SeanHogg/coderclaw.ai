## coderClawLLM Add-ons

The coderClawLLM proxy is billed separately from seat licences on the managed cloud:

| Add-on | Price | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Extra LLM requests** (Free) | $5 / 10k requests | Top up when you hit the 1,000 req/month limit |
| **Extra LLM requests** (Pro) | $3 / 10k requests | Top up when you hit the 50,000 req/month limit |
| **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** | Free | Route calls through your own Anthropic / OpenAI API key; no proxy cost |

Track usage at `GET /llm/v1/usage?days=30` or in the portal under **Settings → Usage**.

---

## Self-Hosted Deployments

**coderClawLink is MIT-licensed.** You can run the full platform — portal, API, relay, and database — on your own infrastructure at zero licensing cost.

Self-hosted users are responsible for:
- Cloudflare Workers account and compute costs
- Postgres database (Neon, Supabase, or self-managed)
- Any LLM API keys used by agents

The `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` in the repo support `dev`, `deploy`, and `migrate` profiles for Docker-based self-hosted deployments. See [Getting Started](/link/getting-started/) for full setup instructions.

---

## Upgrading and Downgrading

```http
# Upgrade to Pro (requires billing details in the request body)
POST /api/tenants/:id/subscription/pro

# Downgrade to Free (effective end of current billing period)
POST /api/tenants/:id/subscription/free

# Check current plan and usage
GET /api/tenants/:id/subscription
```

Downgrades take effect at the **end of the current billing period** and are non-refundable for the remainder of that period. All data is retained for 30 days after downgrade before applying Free-tier retention limits.

## FAQ

**Can I try Pro before paying?**
Yes — new accounts get a **14-day Pro trial** with no credit card required. Trial limits match the Pro plan.

**What happens when I hit LLM request limits?**
Requests beyond the monthly limit are queued (not dropped). You will receive a warning email at 80% usage. You can purchase add-on blocks or enable BYOK to avoid interruption.

**Do I pay per Claw or per user?**
Pro billing is **per seat (user)**, not per Claw. You can register unlimited Claws on Pro without additional seat charges.

**Is my data private if I use the managed cloud?**
Yes. All data is tenant-isolated in Postgres. coderClaw.ai staff cannot access your data without an explicit impersonation record in the audit log. See the [Privacy Policy](https://coderclaw.ai/privacy) for full details.

**Can I switch between self-hosted and managed cloud?**
Yes. Export your data at any time via the API. Migration tooling is available in the [CoderClaw CLI](https://github.com/SeanHogg/coderClaw).

**Where can I ask questions?**
