```jsonc
// Approval decision
{ "type": "approval.decision", "approvalId": "…", "status": "approved" | "rejected", "reviewNote": "…" }

// Remote task forwarded to claw
{ "type": "remote.task", "correlationId": "<uuid>", "task": "…" }
```

### Inbound (claw → portal)

```jsonc
// Execution state change
{ "type": "status_change", "executionId": "…", "status": "running" | "completed" | "failed" }

// Remote task result
{ "type": "remote.result", "taskCorrelationId": "<uuid>", "fromClawId": "<clawId>", "result": "…", "status": "completed" | "failed", "error": "<optional>" }

// Workflow live update
