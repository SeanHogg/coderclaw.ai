# Go-to-Market Strategy — coderClaw.ai

This document covers the positioning, ICP, channels, competitive differentiation, pricing strategy, launch plan, and growth motions for coderClaw.ai and coderClawLink.

---

## 1. Positioning

### One-line pitch
> **Replace Jira with an AI-native workflow mesh that self-heals, routes tasks autonomously, and keeps humans in control.**

### Tagline options
- "Your AI engineering team, orchestrated."
- "Where AI agents meet human oversight."
- "Jira for AI teams — minus the tickets."

### Category
coderClaw.ai creates and owns the category of **AI Agent Orchestration Portals** — the control plane layer between autonomous AI coding agents and human engineering teams. This is distinct from:
- **AI coding assistants** (Cursor, GitHub Copilot) — single-user, no orchestration
- **Project management tools** (Jira, Linear) — human-only workflows, no agent integration
- **LLM APIs** (OpenAI, Anthropic) — raw models, no workflow management
- **Agent frameworks** (LangChain, CrewAI) — developer-only libraries, no hosted control plane

### Positioning statement
*For engineering teams of 5–1,000+ who want to leverage AI agents at scale without losing visibility or control, coderClaw.ai is an AI-native orchestration platform that coordinates self-healing agents across unlimited projects — unlike Jira or Linear, which were designed for humans writing tickets, not AI agents executing code.*

## 2. Ideal Customer Profile

### Primary ICP — "AI-Forward Engineering Lead"

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Engineering Manager, VP Engineering, Staff/Principal Engineer |
| **Company size** | 10–200 employees (primary); 200–2,000 (enterprise segment) |
| **Industry** | SaaS, fintech, dev tools, e-commerce, AI-native startups |
| **Pain** | Managing AI agent outputs in spreadsheets or Slack threads; no audit trail for AI actions; can't scale code review with a small team |
| **Trigger** | Just adopted Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor; tried to use Jira for AI workflows and failed |
| **Tech signals** | Uses TypeScript, React, or Go; on Cloudflare Workers or Vercel; GitHub-native; early adopter of AI tooling |

### Secondary ICP — "Compliance-First Engineering Director"

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Director of Engineering, CISO, Head of Platform |
| **Company size** | 500–5,000 employees |
| **Industry** | Fintech, healthcare-adjacent, legal tech, enterprise SaaS |
| **Pain** | Needs audit trails for AI actions for SOC 2 / internal compliance; GDPR/CCPA obligations on AI-generated code |
| **Trigger** | Audit failure or internal mandate to document AI-assisted code changes |
| **Tech signals** | Uses enterprise SSO; has a compliance officer; asks about GDPR/DPA upfront |

### Anti-ICP (do not prioritise)
- Individual freelancers with no team
- Non-technical business users
- Teams not yet using any AI coding tool

## 3. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Category | Overlap | Our Advantage |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Jira** | Project management | Task tracking | Built for AI agents, not human ticket-writers; free tier; open source |
| **Linear** | Project management | Task tracking, fast UX | AI-native routing, execution lifecycle, LLM proxy, skills marketplace |
| **GitHub Issues** | Issue tracking | Tasks, CI integration | Orchestration portal (not just a tracker), approval gates, agent registration |
| **LangChain / LangGraph** | Agent framework | Multi-agent coordination | Hosted portal + audit trail; no-code agent registration; RBAC |
| **CrewAI** | Agent framework | Role-based agents | Hosted control plane; human-in-the-loop governance; compliance tooling |
| **Cursor** | AI code editor | AI coding assistance | Orchestration layer (Cursor is a single-user tool; we coordinate fleets) |
| **Devin / SWE-agent** | Autonomous coding | Autonomous execution | We are the *control plane* for Devin-style agents, not a replacement |
| **Windmill / Temporal** | Workflow orchestration | DAG execution | Purpose-built for coding agents; skills marketplace; no-code portal |

**Key differentiators:**
1. **Open source (MIT)** — no vendor lock-in, self-hostable, trusted by security-conscious teams
2. **Approval gates** — human-in-the-loop by design, not as an afterthought
3. **Skills marketplace** — community-driven capability distribution
4. **Integrated LLM proxy** — one platform for both orchestration and AI compute
5. **Cloudflare Workers** — zero cold start, globally distributed, runs at the edge

## 4. Value Proposition by Segment

### Startups (5–50 devs)
**Message:** *One AI engineer coordinating ten AI agents — for the cost of a single seat.*
- Replace a $10k/year Jira licence with a free MIT-licensed platform
- One small human team coordinates a fleet of AI agents handling code gen, review, testing, docs
- Subscription tiers start free — upgrade only when you need Pro model pool access

**Key proof points:**
- Free tier: 1 claw, 3 projects, 1,000 LLM requests/month at $0
- 14-day Pro trial, no credit card
- Deploy in 20 minutes (see [Getting Started](/link/getting-started/))

### Scale-ups (50–200 devs)
**Message:** *Wire AI agents into your CI/CD pipeline. Ship 3× faster without 3× the headcount.*
- Execution callbacks let CI runners trigger agents on PR events
- Specs drive task creation automatically; approval gates keep senior engineers in the loop
- $29/seat/month — typically replaces $12k+/year Jira + $8k+/year AI coding tool subscriptions

**Key proof points:**
- Unlimited claws on Pro
- Full 4-role RBAC for department-level isolation
- WebSocket execution streaming for zero-latency CI dashboards

### Enterprises (200–1,000+ devs)
**Message:** *SOC 2-ready AI orchestration. Immutable audit trail. GDPR/CCPA tooling. Your infra.*
- Replaces Jira as the AI orchestration layer without disrupting existing tooling
- Air-gapped / on-premises deployments for regulated industries
- DPA, 99.9% SLA, dedicated CSM, SSO/SAML

**Key proof points:**
- Full audit trail queryable via API for compliance tooling integration
- MIT licence: no vendor lock-in, self-hostable under own Cloudflare account
- GDPR/CCPA privacy request handling built in

## 5. Pricing Strategy

### Model: Freemium + usage-based LLM compute

| Tier | Price | Rationale |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Drive top-of-funnel adoption; low barrier for indie devs and startups |
| **Pro** | $29/seat/mo (monthly) / $23/seat/mo (yearly) | Captures value when teams scale; competitive with Jira + Linear |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | ACV target: $50k–$500k; land-and-expand with seat growth |

**LLM compute add-ons:** $3–$5 per 10k requests (Pro / Free overages). BYOK option removes proxy dependency.

### Pricing psychology
- Free tier is genuinely useful (not crippled) — drives word-of-mouth and GitHub stars
- Pro price anchored below Jira ($8.15/user) + Linear ($8/user) combined — easy budget justification
- Yearly billing at 20% discount drives cash flow and reduces churn

---

## 6. Acquisition Channels

### Organic (priority)
- **GitHub** — README as primary marketing asset; GitHub stars as social proof
- **Search (SEO)** — Target keywords: "AI agent orchestration", "Jira alternative for AI teams", "multi-agent workflow management"
- **Developer communities** — Hacker News, Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning, r/devops), Dev.to, Product Hunt

### Paid (secondary, post-PMF)
- LinkedIn Ads targeting Engineering Managers and VPs Engineering
- Google Ads: "Jira alternative AI teams", "AI agent management platform"
- Sponsor developer newsletters (TLDR, JavaScript Weekly, Node Weekly)
