# CoderClaw Overview

CoderClaw is a **self-hosted, open-source AI coding assistant** that connects your favorite messaging apps to powerful AI agents. Run it on your own infrastructure — no cloud lock-in, no data leaving your control.

It is also a **self-healing AI engineering agent and orchestration platform** that manages tasks, workflows, and collaboration across all AI agents. It provides persistent memory, context-aware reasoning, and self-repair — allowing AI systems to detect failures, fix themselves, and adapt over time — while keeping humans in the loop for governance and approval.

## TL;DR

**CoderClaw** connects messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and more) to AI coding agents with a secure, extensible gateway.

- Personal use → spin up with a single command, message your AI from anywhere
- Team use → add RBAC, distributed execution, and audit logs as you grow
- **Self-healing** → agents detect failures, fix themselves, and adapt over time
- **Persistent memory** → context and knowledge survive restarts and session changes
- **Human-in-the-loop** → governance, approval flows, and audit trails built in
- **Any scale** → startups (5–50 devs) through enterprise (100–1,000+ devs)

## What is CoderClaw?

CoderClaw is a **self-hosted multi-channel AI gateway** that lets you interact with AI coding agents through the chat apps you already use. It is also a **self-hosted multi-agent AI orchestration platform** that coordinates specialized agents across the full development lifecycle — planning, coding, reviewing, testing, debugging, and refactoring — while maintaining persistent context and enabling self-repair.

**Core Features:**

- Multi-channel messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage)
- WebSocket control plane for clients, nodes, and a web control UI
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Mobile nodes (iOS/Android)
- Canvas and voice features
- Tool system with skills support
- Self-healing agent runtime (failure detection, auto-repair, adaptive execution)
- Persistent memory and context-aware reasoning across sessions
- Multi-agent orchestration with 7 built-in roles and custom agent support
- Human-in-the-loop governance with approval flows and audit trails
- CI/CD integration and private/self-hosted deployment support

**coderClawLLM** — a pay-per-use API layer for AI agent compute — is included for teams who need managed model access without managing their own provider keys.

**Best For:**

- Personal AI assistant accessible from any device
- Small teams in a trusted environment
- Local or distributed execution
- Projects requiring full data sovereignty

## Use Cases

### Personal and Small Team Use

✅ Personal AI assistant for messaging apps
✅ Small trusted team (2-5 people)
✅ Local execution is sufficient
✅ Basic allowlist security is enough
✅ No need for audit trails
✅ Simple deployment model

**Example**: "I want an AI assistant I can message on WhatsApp from my phone that runs on my Mac at home."

### Startup Use (5–50 developers)

✅ Use AI as a virtual workforce to ship faster with a small team
✅ Self-healing agents handle failures automatically, reducing on-call burden
✅ Persistent memory means agents understand your codebase without re-explaining
✅ Builderforce.ai gives a Jira-like view of what every agent is doing (api.builderforce.ai)
✅ coderClawLLM provides pay-per-use compute without managing provider keys

**Example**: "We're a 10-person startup. Our AI agents write code, review PRs, and fix failing tests automatically — all visible in Builderforce.ai. We don't need a dedicated DevOps engineer to babysit CI."

### Team and Enterprise Use

✅ Development team (5+ people)
✅ Need remote or distributed execution
✅ Require RBAC and granular permissions
✅ Need comprehensive audit logs
✅ CI/CD automation requirements
✅ Enterprise compliance needs
✅ Multi-tenant deployments
✅ Complex multi-agent pipelines with deterministic execution and full audit trails
✅ Human-in-the-loop approval gates for sensitive changes
✅ Private/self-hosted deployments for air-gapped or regulated environments

**Example**: "Our team needs an AI assistant that runs on a shared server, with different permission levels for developers, reviewers, and CI pipelines, plus full audit logs for compliance."

**Extended example**: "Our team needs AI agents that orchestrate across 50 microservice repos, with different permission levels for developers, reviewers, and CI pipelines, plus full audit logs for compliance — all governed by Builderforce.ai."

## FAQ

**Q: Can I run CoderClaw on the same machine as other services?**

A: Yes, just ensure the gateway port (18789) is not in use by another process.

**Q: Is CoderClaw expensive to run?**

A: No. Enterprise features add minimal overhead. API costs depend on which AI models you configure.

**Q: Can I switch configurations easily?**

A: Yes. Backup your `~/.coderclaw` directory to preserve your configuration.

**Q: Which setup should I start with?**

A: If you're just exploring — start simple. If you know you need team features — enable enterprise capabilities from the start.

## Summary

**CoderClaw** = Self-hosted, open-source AI coding assistant + multi-channel messaging gateway + self-healing multi-agent orchestration platform.

- Connects messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and more) to powerful AI coding agents
- Manages tasks, workflows, and collaboration across all AI agents
- Persistent memory and context-aware reasoning across sessions
- Self-repair: agents detect failures, fix themselves, and adapt over time
- Human-in-the-loop governance with approval flows and audit trails
- **[Builderforce.ai](https://builderforce.ai)** (API: api.builderforce.ai) replaces Jira with a centralized orchestration portal (replaces CoderClawLink)
- **coderClawLLM** — pay-per-use API layer for AI agent compute

Choose your setup based on requirements:

- **Solo or small team + local only** — start with the default configuration
- **Startup (5–50 devs)** — use AI as a virtual workforce with full visibility in Builderforce.ai
- **Team or enterprise + distributed + security** — enable enterprise runtime features
- **Enterprise (100–1,000+ devs)** — multi-agent pipelines with RBAC, audit trails, and human approval gates
