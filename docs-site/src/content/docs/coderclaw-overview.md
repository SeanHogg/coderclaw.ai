## Use Cases

### Personal and Small Team Use

✅ Personal AI assistant for messaging apps
✅ Small trusted team (2-5 people)
✅ Local execution is sufficient
✅ Basic allowlist security is enough
✅ No need for audit trails
✅ Simple deployment model

**Example**: "I want an AI assistant I can message on WhatsApp from my phone that runs on my Mac at home."

### Team and Enterprise Use

✅ Development team (5+ people)
✅ Need remote or distributed execution
✅ Require RBAC and granular permissions
✅ Need comprehensive audit logs
✅ CI/CD automation requirements
✅ Enterprise compliance needs
✅ Multi-tenant deployments

**Example**: "Our team needs an AI assistant that runs on a shared server, with different permission levels for developers, reviewers, and CI pipelines, plus full audit logs for compliance."

**Q: Which setup should I start with?**

A: If you're just exploring — start simple. If you know you need team features — enable enterprise capabilities from the start.

## Summary

**CoderClaw** = Self-hosted, open-source AI coding assistant + multi-channel messaging gateway.

Choose your setup based on requirements:

- **Solo or small team + local only** — start with the default configuration
- **Team or enterprise + distributed + security** — enable enterprise runtime features
