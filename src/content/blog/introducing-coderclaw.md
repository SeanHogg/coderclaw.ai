The future of development isn't about writing more code—it's about orchestrating intelligent agents that handle the work for you.

Today, I'm excited to introduce **CoderClaw**, the ultimate coding agent framework designed for developers who want to transition from coding to managing business outcomes.

## What is CoderClaw?

CoderClaw is a powerful framework for building autonomous coding agents that can:

- **Manage Complex Tasks**: Break down large development projects into independent, manageable agent workflows
- **Coordinate Multiple Agents**: Create hierarchical agent structures where parent agents manage sub-agents working in parallel
- **Orchestrate Across Your Mesh**: Use CoderClawLink to coordinate agents, projects, and services across your entire development infrastructure
- **Focus on Outcomes**: Stop writing boilerplate and start defining what you want to achieve. Let the agents handle the execution.

## Core Capabilities

### Autonomous Agents
Create specialized agents for different tasks—code review, testing, documentation, performance optimization, and more. Each agent runs independently and reports back on progress.

### Sub-Agent Architecture
For complex projects, parent agents can dynamically create and manage sub-agents. This enables true parallel processing and dramatically improves throughput on large tasks.

### Mesh Orchestration with CoderClawLink
CoderClawLink is the brain of your agent network. It:
- Provides service discovery for agents across your infrastructure
- Manages inter-agent communication and coordination
- Monitors agent health and performance in real-time
- Handles task distribution and load balancing

### Full System Access
Agents can:
- Read and write files in your workspace
- Execute shell commands and scripts
- Browse the web and interact with APIs
- Integrate with 50+ services and platforms
- Control your IDE and development tools

## Why CoderClaw?

### Transition from Coding to Management
Stop writing code. Start managing agents that write code for you. CoderClaw lets you focus on business outcomes while agents handle technical execution.

### Built for Scale
Whether you're working on a single project or orchestrating hundreds of agents across multiple teams, CoderClaw scales with you.

### Your Infrastructure, Your Rules
CoderClaw runs where you choose—on your machine, in your homelab, or on a private server. Your code stays secure. You control everything.

### Community-Driven
Extend CoderClaw with community-created skills. Build your own. Share them with others. The framework grows with your needs.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is simple:

```bash
curl https://get.coderclaw.ai | sh
```

That's it. The installer handles everything—Node.js, dependencies, and setup.

Then create your first agent:

```typescript
import { Agent } from 'coderclaw';

const codeReviewer = new Agent({
  name: 'CodeReviewer',
  model: 'claude-opus',
  instructions: 'You are an expert code reviewer. Analyze code and provide detailed feedback.'
});

const result = await codeReviewer.run({
  task: 'Review this code for issues',
  input: sourceCode
});
```

## What's Included

CoderClaw comes with:

- **Framework SDK** for building and managing agents
- **CoderClawLink Dashboard** for orchestration and monitoring
- **50+ Pre-built Integrations** (Discord, Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- **Community Skills Directory** for extending functionality
- **Complete Documentation** and examples
- **Security Best Practices** and threat modeling

## The Road Ahead

We're focused on:

1. **Performance**: Optimizing agent execution speed and reducing latency
2. **Reliability**: Hardening the mesh orchestration layer
3. **Security**: Continuous security audits and improvements
4. **Ecosystem**: Growing the community skills library
5. **Models**: Supporting new LLMs and providers

## Join the Community

The strength of CoderClaw comes from developers like you. Whether you're building agents, contributing skills, reporting issues, or sharing ideas—you're making this framework better.
